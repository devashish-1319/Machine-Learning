# Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project addresses the challenge of predicting the likelihood of an individual having a heart disease based on their health conditions. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease. The target variable is whether the individual has a heart disease (1) or not (0).
